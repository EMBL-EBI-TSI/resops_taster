# ResOps course at EMBL-EBI: a taster session
Welcome to the EMBL-EBI organised taster session of our ResOps course. Today we'll have a short presentation introducing you to the course and the materials, and we'll try to squeeze in as much of the practical as we can. If you're lost, please refer to the presentation here: https://goo.gl/Yx27bK or start at the Practical1.md document.
